# Research Paper Summarizer
```markdown
Welcome to the **Research Paper Summarizer** project! This platform allows users to upload research papers (in PDF format) and receive concise, summarized text in text, PDF, or Word document formats. The website leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to process academic papers and generate summaries, making it easier for researchers and students to quickly understand key insights.

## Features

- **Paper Upload**: Users can upload research papers in PDF format.
- **Automatic Summarization**: The system extracts and summarizes key information from the research paper.
- **Downloadable Summaries**: Summaries are available for download in text, PDF, or Word formats.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and simple user interface for smooth interaction.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Choose from text, PDF, or Word for the summary download.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or FastAPI for API services
- **NLP Model**: Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, GPT-based models for summarization)
- **Document Generation**: ReportLab (for PDF generation), python-docx (for Word document generation)
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for storing metadata of papers and summaries)
- **Authentication**: OAuth or JWT for user login/authentication
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP for hosting, Heroku for simplicity

## Project Flowchart

Below is the basic flowchart describing how the Research Paper Summarizer works:

```
+-------------------+      +-----------------------+      +-------------------+
|  User Uploads     | ---> |  Paper Processing     | ---> |  Summarization    |
|  PDF Document     |      |  (Extract Text)       |      |  (Summarize Text) |
+-------------------+      +-----------------------+      +-------------------+
                                 |
                                 v
                       +------------------+     +---------------------+
                       |  Generate Output | --->|  Provide Download   |
                       |  (Text, PDF,     |     |  Options (Text,     |
                       |   Word Format)   |     |   PDF, Word)        |
                       +------------------+     +---------------------+
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your local machine:
- **Python 3.x** (for backend)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for frontend)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-paper-summarizer.git
   cd research-paper-summarizer/backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add necessary configurations like API keys (e.g., Hugging Face API) and database credentials.

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing

To test the application locally:
- Upload a PDF research paper.
- View the summarized output and select your preferred download format (text, PDF, or Word).

## Usage

1. **Upload Research Paper**: The user uploads a PDF file from their local device.
2. **Summarization Process**: The backend processes the paper, extracts the text, and summarizes the key points.
3. **Download Summary**: Once the summary is generated, the user can choose to download it in one of three formats: text, PDF, or Word.
4. **User Interface**: The user can interact with the frontend to upload papers and receive summarized outputs.

## Contributing
